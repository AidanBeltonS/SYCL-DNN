/**
 * \file
 * X-Macro definiton file for VGG pooling sizes.
 *
 * Contains a number of calls to the VGG_PARAMS function-like macro defining
 * the following pooling parameters, as used in the VGG network.
 *
 * The ordering of the arguments is:
 * \code
 *   VGG_PARAMS(Channels, Input Width, Input Height)
 * \endcode
 * The pooling neighbourhoods are all 2x2, and the strides are all 1.
 *
 * Channels | Width | Height | Window | Stride 
 * ---------|-------|--------|--------|-------
 *       64 |   224 |    224 |      2 |      1 
 *      128 |   112 |    112 |      2 |      1 
 *      256 |    56 |     56 |      2 |      1 
 *      512 |    28 |     28 |      2 |      1 
 *      512 |    14 |     14 |      2 |      1
