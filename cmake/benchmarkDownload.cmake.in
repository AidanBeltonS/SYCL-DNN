# Template cmake file to download benchmark library.
#
# Expected use:
#   Use `configure_file` to copy this template into a new directory, as
#   CMakeLists.txt. Then call cmake to download the library and use
#   `add_subdirectory` to add the targets of the library into the current cmake
#   build.
