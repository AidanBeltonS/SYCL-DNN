# [Bug | Feature]

## Details

<!-- if a feature, please describe what's missing, and how it would be
useful to you. A measure of urgency would help us understand how to
prioritise feature requests against our other work. -->

<!-- if a bug, a comprehensive description of what's going on would be
very helpful. Is it a crash? Is it a wrong result in a test? Is there
some other unexpected behaviour?
Steps to reproduce are incredibly important. To that end, a list of
what you must do to cause the error goes a long way.
Finally, we might need to replicate your set up in some way, so a list
of hardware and software used will often help narrow down the problem.
We aren't always able to do this but it can help point at where the
issue is coming from if there are differences. -->

* GCC/Clang version:
* ComputeCpp version:
* OpenCL impl:

<!-- if running on an OpenCL device, the output from `clinfo` can be
very helpful. It shows device details that can help us diagnose
problems. Similarly, computecpp_info, which is shipped as part of the
ComputeCpp package, will show more details that can help identify
what might be going wrong. -->
